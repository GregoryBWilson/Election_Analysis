# Election_Analysis

This README file is going to be used by me to keep track of what I am doing as I work on the Module 3 Challenge Election Analysis.

## Nov 23

- Created the Election_Analysis Repository

## Nov 28

- Downloaded the PyPoll_Challenge_start_code.py from https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1177/assignments/19903?module_item_id=355151

- Ran the code in Bash an read errors

- Read error messages about missing folders and files

- Used Bash to create a Resources Folder

- Download the election_results.csv file and put it in the Resources folder from https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1177/pages/3-dot-3-1-import-and-inspect-the-data?module_item_id=355059

- Inspected the file using Excel it has three column headers: Ballot ID, County, and Candidate and 369,712 rows

- Created a folder "analysis"

- Started working on the PyPoll Challenge

  ## Nov 29
